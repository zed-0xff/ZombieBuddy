[h1]ZombieBuddy[/h1]

A powerful framework for Project Zomboid modders that enables Java bytecode manipulation and runtime patching of game classes using ByteBuddy.

[b]Features:[/b]
[list]
[*] Annotation-based patching with [code]@Patch(className = "...", methodName = "...")[/code] annotations
[*] Runtime class transformation - patch classes that are already loaded
[*] Automatic patch discovery - scans for patch classes automatically
[*] Lua integration - expose Java classes to Lua scripting
[*] Support for both advice-based and delegation-based patching
[/list]

[b]What it does:[/b]
ZombieBuddy allows modders to patch game classes at runtime using bytecode manipulation, without requiring access to the game's source code. No manual file replacement needed - patches are applied automatically at game startup.

[b]⚠️ Security Warning:[/b]
Java mods enabled through ZombieBuddy have unrestricted access to your system and can execute arbitrary code. Only install Java mods from sources you trust completely. Review source code when available.
