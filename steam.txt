[h1]ZombieBuddy[/h1]

A powerful framework for Project Zomboid modders that enables Java bytecode manipulation and runtime patching of game classes using ByteBuddy.

[b]Features:[/b]
[list]
[*] Annotation-based patching with [code]@Patch(className = "...", methodName = "...")[/code] annotations
[*] Runtime class transformation - patch classes that are already loaded
[*] Automatic patch discovery - scans for patch classes automatically
[*] Lua integration - expose Java classes to Lua scripting
[*] Support for both advice-based and delegation-based patching
[/list]

[b]What it does:[/b]
ZombieBuddy allows modders to patch game classes at runtime using bytecode manipulation, without requiring access to the game's source code. No manual file replacement needed - patches are applied automatically at game startup.

[b]📦 Installation (One-Time Setup):[/b]

[b]Step 1:[/b] Subscribe to ZombieBuddy on Steam Workshop

[b]Step 2:[/b] Manual installation is required ONLY ONCE for ZombieBuddy itself. Follow the instructions for your platform:

[b]🪟 Windows Installation:[/b]
[list]
[*] Copy both ZombieBuddy.jar and zbNative.dll from the mod's [code]build/libs/[/code] directory to your game directory (typically [code]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid\[/code])
[*] Open Project Zomboid's launch options in Steam
[*] Add this JVM argument: [code]-agentlib:zbNative --[/code]
[*] [b]⚠️ IMPORTANT:[/b] The -- at the end is mandatory - do not omit it!
[/list]

[b]🍎 macOS / 🐧 Linux Installation:[/b]
[list]
[*] Copy ZombieBuddy.jar from the mod's [code]build/libs/[/code] directory to:
[list]
[*] [b]macOS:[/b] [code]~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/Project Zomboid.app/Contents/Java/[/code]
[*] [b]Linux:[/b] [code]~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid/java/[/code]
[/list]
[*] Open Project Zomboid's launch options in Steam
[*] Add this JVM argument: [code]-javaagent:ZombieBuddy.jar --[/code]
[*] [b]⚠️ IMPORTANT:[/b] The -- at the end is mandatory - do not omit it!
[/list]

[b]Step 3:[/b] After this one-time setup, all other mods that use the ZombieBuddy framework will work automatically - no additional manual installation needed!

[b]✅ Why This Method is Better:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]More Reliable:[/b] Runtime bytecode patching is more stable than manual file replacements
[*] [b]Update-Proof:[/b] Minor game updates will NOT break your mods - patches are applied at runtime, so they adapt to game changes automatically
[*] [b]No File Conflicts:[/b] Multiple mods can patch the same class without conflicts
[*] [b]Easy Management:[/b] Once ZombieBuddy is set up, just subscribe to mods that use it - they'll work immediately
[/list]

[b]⚠️ Security Warning:[/b]
Java mods enabled through ZombieBuddy have unrestricted access to your system and can execute arbitrary code. Only install Java mods from sources you trust completely. Review source code when available.
